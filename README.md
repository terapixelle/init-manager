# Init Manager

v1.0 Alpha

### Initiative enhancements for [Roll20](https://roll20.net) campaigns

## :book: Backstory

Keeping an adventuring party in check is like herding a bunch of cats. During combat, it can be even more challenging to keep track of initiative order in a virtual setting. This is where Init Manager can give you advantage!

This extension was built as a side project for a D&D campaign among virtual friends. It will be battle-tested, honed, and polished during our adventures. 

## :earth_americas: Supported Planes (Browsers)

As this extension is actively under development, the supported browsers will grow. We are building and testing in recent versions of Google Chrome and Opera.

## :boom: Actions (What It Does) 

### For DMs

- When the Turn Order modal is opened, a custom banner will appear at the top of the browser window, overlaying the map. This custom banner will provide the name and token icon (if available) of the player or creature who has initiative.

- A chat message is automatically sent (from the DM) to notify all players of initiative start, change, and end.

- When Turn Order is closed, the banner will disappear.


### For Players

- Players will be able to see the custom banner and receive chat messages as the DM starts initiative and advances through initiatve order.

## :star2: Leveling Up (What It Will Eventually Do)

- [ ] Allow players to see the custom banner. Currently, players can only see the chat messages automatically sent on the DM's behalf.

- [ ] Download from the official Chrome Web Store

- [ ] Additional browser support

- [ ] More design elements (with options to turn them on or off)

- [ ] Add sounds or more visual changes?

- [ ] Customization options
